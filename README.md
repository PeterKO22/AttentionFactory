## Attention Factory: Intelligent Attention Management System

### Project Background

In daily life, we often need to handle a large amount of information and tasks. How to effectively manage and utilize this information has become an important challenge. Traditional note-taking and calendar tools can help us record information and schedule appointments, but they have some limitations, such as lacking intelligent assistance and automatic information aggregation.

### Attention Factory: Solving the Challenges of Attention Management

Attention Factory is an artificial intelligence-based attention management system designed to help users better manage their attention and time. It achieves this goal through three aspects:

#### 1. Information Recording and Organization

Firstly, Attention Factory provides a note-taking function similar to a memorandum, where users can record noteworthy information. This information can include tasks, schedules, meetings, ideas, etc.

#### 2. Automated Scheduling

Secondly, the system generates automated scheduling arrangements based on user habits, templates, and attention models. This means users no longer need to manually input schedules but can rely on the system to intelligently recommend the most suitable time slots.

#### 3. Continuous Optimization and Improvement

Lastly, through regular feedback results, users can evaluate and adjust the system's suggestions, thereby improving the cognitive-attention model. This allows Attention Factory to become increasingly intelligent and personalized over time.
